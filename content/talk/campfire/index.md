title: "Learn the basics of R with Chuck`s Lanfear courses"
subtitle: "Testing"
excerpt: "Although the name of the course is Introduction to R for Social Scientists, it`s much more than that and it teaches you the basic to intermediate (sometimes advanced) techniques for data science that you can use in any field. This is the most complete, funny and free resource that I found on the internet for learning R. "
